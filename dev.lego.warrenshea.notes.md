# Keys aspects to this solution

1. Website Data and Content (APIs) separated from Presentation (HTML/CSS) and Logic (JavaScript)
2. Website Data and Content (APIs) agnostic to code bases*
*This is partially bad if you need to maintain many components across codebases*
3. Copy, Design, Layout can be done by separate individuals
4. Copy can be edited in the "Copy" section of the page
5. Design (padding, margin, border, background color, border radius) can be edited in the "Design" section of the page
6. Layout (components dragged into hotspots) can be edited in the "Layout" section of the page

# Component Library

All Components follow this format:

```json
"component-name": {
  "properties": {
  },
  "hotspot-#": {
  },
}
```
Where # can be as many hotspots for that component as you want
OR
```json
"component-name": {
  "properties": {
  },
}
```
Which is a "Leaf Node" component - no component can go inside this.
A link/A button/An image are good examples of this type of component.
