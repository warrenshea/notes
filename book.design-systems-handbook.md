## Introduction
A design system unites product teams around a common visual language. It:
* Reduces design debt
* Accelerates the design process
* Builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life


## 1 Introducting Design Systems: The power of scale

### Scaling design with systems thinking
* Standards
* Components

### The value of design systems
* Scale Design
* Manage your debt
* Design consistently
* Prototype faster
* Iterate more quickly
* Improve usability
* Build in accessibility

### Myths of design systems
* Too limiting
* Loss of creativity
* One and done


## 2 Designing your design system: Step by step

### Who should be involved
* Designers, Front-end Developers, a11y experts, content strategists, researches, performance experts, product managers, leaders
* Choosing the right team model: solitary (overlord), centralized (dedicated team), federated (various team members join)
* Creating a visual inventory:
  * Conducting a visual audit
* Creating a visual design language
  * Design Tokens: subatomic, name & value pairs stored as data
  * Colors
    * Interactive items should be the same color background color to help the user
  * Typography (size, leading (line spacing), typefaces)
    * Leading is usually 1.5 for a11y reasons, 1.25/1.125 for headings.
  * Spacing (margins, paddings, position coordinates, border spacing)
  * Images (icons, illustrations)
  * Visual form (depth, elevation, shadows, rounded corners, textures)
  * Motion
  * Sound
* Creating a user interface library
  * Elements (basics/atoms)
  * Componetns (molecules/modules)
  * Regions (zones/organisms)
  * Layouts


## 3 Building your design system: A strong foundation


## 4 Putting your design system into practice: Better together


## 5 Expanding your design system: More than the sum of its parts


## 6 The future of design systems: To infinity and beyond
